# tango_with_django_project
This is the up to date project for WAD from UofG Computing with working test cases compared to the archived variant.

For running, use a pyhton virtual environment (currently running miniConda), which will need both Django version 2.2.28 and Pillow installed via pip.
Call the virtual environment rango to avoid clashing.
